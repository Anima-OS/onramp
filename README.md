# Firefox OnRamp

This a first attempt at making it as easy as possible to go from zero to set up and ready to work on Mozilla projects,
starting with Firefox for the Desktop and Firefox for Android.

Feedback, patches and further assistance are always welcome; even a note saying "this worked for me!" with some information about your platform and hardware would be valuable feedback, and if anything _doesn't_ work for you, I definitely want to know!

If you have comments or questions you can direct them to Mike Hoye - mhoye@mozilla.com - or file them as issues here.

Thank you.
